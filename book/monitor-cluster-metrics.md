# Monitoring metrics with Sysdig

Sysdig Monitor is part of Sysdigâ€™s container intelligence platform. Sysdig uses a unified platform to deliver security, monitoring, and forensics in a container and microservices-friendly architecture.

Once the agent has started sending metrics to Sysdig for your environment, you can use the Sysdig Monitor UI to view and analyze that data.

## Provision an instance of Monitoring with Sysdig service

1. Go to the [**Observability** category](https://cloud.ibm.com/observe)
